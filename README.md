# A combat manager for PF2E

âš  This software is not supported, endorsed, or approved by Paizo Inc, or any associated groups.

Combat Driver allows you to create and share individual combat encounters for the PF2E tabletop system while letting you search through a list of monsters and NPCs with many search and filter options.
Combat Driver will also allow you to efficiently create your own enemies and modify existing ones, and allows you to measure up an encounter's difficulty in comparison to your game party.

## Basic Details
Enemies can be searched from and filtered through from the EnemyDatabase table. Most filtering options work. Encounters can be saved and loaded using Ctrl+S and Ctrl+O, respectively.


## Work In Progress

This project is still in its early stages, and is thus incomplete for the time being. The major features that currently function:
* Searching through enemies
* Filtering and sorting enemies in different conditions
* Bundling up enemies as encounters, along with tracking HP
* Saving and loading encounters
* Clicking on rolls on an enemy sheet to quickly do a D20 roll for that number

The major features that are not yet available are:
* Automatically listing encounter strength based on party level/size
* Allowing creation of custom enemies
* Allowing modification of pre-existing enemies

The appearance of the software will also receive a makeover in the long-term.

This project is created in Godot 4.3.
