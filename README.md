# A combat manager for Pathfinder Second Edition

âš  This software is not supported, endorsed, or approved by Paizo Inc, Archives of Nethys, or any associated groups.

Want a program to track pre-made and custom-made enemies in Pathfinder Second Edition? Look no further, as Combat Driver allows you to create and share individual combat encounters while letting you search through a list of Pathfinder monsters and NPCs with a myriad of search and filter options.
Combat Driver also allows you to efficiently create your own enemies and modify existing ones, and allows you to measure up an encounter's difficulty in comparison to your game party.

## Work In Progress

This project is still in its early stages, and is thus incomplete for the time being. Thank you for your patience!


This project is created in Godot 4.1.
